Computational Vision (Master in AI)

Description:

This course introduces the main aspects of computational vision, from fundamentals on image formation and basic image operations until object recognition, going through the main problems of computer vision: segmentation,keypoint extraction, pattern recognition and face recognition. The classical and the latest state-of-the-art methods will be revised for the computer vision problems and methods will be used to solve some of these problems.

It consists of 10 Jupyter notebooks.
